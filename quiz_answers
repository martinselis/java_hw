What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
Many, forms.

What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
When we change types from one to another, the type takes a new form.
For example, using an interface.

What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
By using an interface and changing types.
By using method overriding (override the super method) or method overloading (having method with the same name but different types).

How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
As many as your imagination can hold (by using interfaces, method overloading, method overriding).

Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
Add an interface to 2 different classes. When requiring an ArrayList of combined classes, define arraylist as containing interface.

Composition
What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Has-a relationship. Class holds other objects.

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
When creating a class and adding an object to it as property.

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
Looser coupling (adding as property instead of inheriting gives bigger flexibility).

When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
They remain in memory, if used elsewhere.
